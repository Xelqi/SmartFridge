Smart Fridge is a responsive web application designed to tackle the issue of sustainability using
innovative technological solutions while also integrating into every lifestyle. Smart Fridge utilises
Image Processing and Generative Artificial Intelligence to streamline item management
revolutionising the tedious process adding items individually to virtual storage spaces. The
application not only serves as an virtual storage system, but also is a companion sending users
reminders of items that are expiring. With the aim of reducing food waste the application allows for
users to get recipes in app and find recipes based on items from their storage. If a user likes a recipe,
they can directly add the items they need to their shopping list minimising food waste and saving
money using items they have. The application allows for shared storages making it perfect for
households whether coordinating meal plans to delegating grocery responsibilities.
